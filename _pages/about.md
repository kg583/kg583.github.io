Hello! My name is KG, and I am second-year mathematics graduate student at the University of Virginia, working under [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono). I am interested in number theory, primarily integer partitions and modular forms.

Here you can find information on my academic ventures, including my [publications](https://kg583.github.io/publications/) and [teaching experience](https://kg583.github.io/teaching/). You can reach out to me via e-mail for questions.
